# Netflix-Data-Analytics
This project focuses on analyzing a Netflix dataset to extract valuable insights and trends using Python.

The project covers data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to understand patterns in the data.

# Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualization of key metrics using Seaborn and Matplotlib

Insights into content trends like type, duration, and correlation between variables

# Technologies Used
Python

Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: Numerical operations

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Data visualization

Scikit-learn: Machine learning (for predictive modeling and preprocessing)

# Data
The dataset includes columns like:

Type: Movie or TV Show

Country: Country of production

Duration: Duration of the content

Other features

Dataset preprocessing includes handling missing values, converting data types, and feature engineering.
